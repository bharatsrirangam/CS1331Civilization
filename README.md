# CivilizationGame
This game was a creation between me and the TA's of CS1331 at Georgia Tech. Its purpose was to learn the fundamentals of Java including but not limited to encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism. This was a homework assignment that made up most of the semester's assignments. Each assignment added to the overall game so that by the end of the semester, we had a fully functioning game (UI developed with Javafx).   

### Prerequisites

You will need Java 7 and Javafx 2.0 or later in order to run the game and play.

## Deployment

In order to run this game, download the src folder into whichever directory you wish to keep the game and run the command 
"java -cp src/main/java runner.CivilizationGame". Be sure to be in the same directory that the src folder is in. 

## Built With

* Java 7
* Javafx 2.2.0

## Versioning

If you wish to use this code for yourself, you can email me at bharatsrirangam@gatech.edu. I cannot promise that I will be able to hand over the code but its always worth a shot!
